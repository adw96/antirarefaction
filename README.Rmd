# antirarefaction

Code accompanying my commentary "Rarefaction, alpha diversity, and statistics."

My plan is to turn this into a package that takes in a phyloseq object, and determines if you're more likely to suffer from Type 1 errors (too small p-values; increased risk of concluding a relationship that isn't reproducible) or Type 2 error (reduced ability to detect a true difference in environments).

Watch this space...
